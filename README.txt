Welcome to your easter egg hunt (sorry this is only getting to you late in the day). Your mission should you choose to accept it - and you’ve made it this far so you’ve probably got at least some interest :) - is to collect 6 easter eggs (5 keys and 1 main egg) scattered throughout the internet… yeah you’d better start searching now…

…jk I’ll give you some hints as well to point you in the right direction.
To begin with though, download the html doc in this repository and open it in a web browser (I’ve only tested it in chrome, so try it in there if things go wrong in other browsers). The rest should be pretty self-explanatory.

Hints:
Key1 - Look for the first youtube video you ever linked me. Meta-hint: its an old music piece you’re fond of, and this vid has about 14 million views.

Key2 - Long has mankind had fingers in multiple pies, but as of late a new variety of Raspberry Pi has emerged of a more electronic nature. It’s most common distributor takes its name from the periodic table (take a look and you’ll si what I mean). Take the number in that distributor’s name as your key.

Key3 - A simple one, what is the best number of things to do 1001 days.

Key4 - This one’s got to do with something about me, that might be documented on a book of faces somewhere.

Key5 - Take a look at IMDB to discover what the 8th most popular move of 2011 was.
